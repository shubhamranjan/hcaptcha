# hCaptcha
A hCAPTCHA library for the browser.



## Credits: 

The biggest credits goes to [AurityLab](https://github.com/AurityLab) for thier library [recaptcha-v3](https://github.com/AurityLab/recaptcha-v3) which was the base boilerplate for this lib. Since, both recaptcha-v3 and hcaptcha are very similar, it seemed feasible to port an existing re-captcha lib to hcaptcha. Most of the code, docs and examples are direct references from [recaptcha-v3](https://github.com/AurityLab/recaptcha-v3).
